# xray-lightning data

[Chest X-Ray](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/folder/36938765345) dataset is used for this project.

*Please check [this notebook](../notebooks/X-ray\ visualization.ipynb) to get familiar with data*

After all images are downloaded from the website and unzipped to `images/` folder (`data/images/` from the root of the repo), the project should have the following structure:

```
> data
    BBox_List_2017.csv
    > images
        00000001_000.png
        00000001_001.png
        00000001_002.png
        00000002_000.png
        ...
```
